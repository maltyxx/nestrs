<!-- Thanks for contributing to NestRS! Keep PRs focused — one logical change each. -->

## What & why

<!-- What does this change do, and why? Link the issue it closes: "Closes #123". -->

## How I verified it

<!--
For HTTP / GraphQL / MCP changes, `just test` is necessary but not sufficient —
routing and wiring bugs don't surface in unit tests. Describe the live checks
you ran (curl, an MCP client, the GraphQL playground). See CONTRIBUTING.md.
