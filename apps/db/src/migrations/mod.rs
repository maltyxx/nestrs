//! Schema migrations, applied in order by [`Migrator`].
//!
//! One file per migration (`m<date>_<seq>_<name>.rs`, kept here so they don't
//! crowd the crate root as they accumulate). To add one: drop the file in this
//! folder, declare its `mod` below, and list its `Migration` in
//! [`Migrator::migrations`] — SeaORM tracks applied ones in `seaql_migrations`.
