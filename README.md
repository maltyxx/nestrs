## Why NestRS

- ⚡ **Rust-native speed.** Built on the same hyper/tokio core as the fastest Rust
  web frameworks — multiples of a Node service's throughput, no GC pauses, and
  tail latencies that stay flat under load.
- 🪶 **An order of magnitude less memory.** A footprint in the tens of MB, not
  hundreds — smaller instances, higher density, a lighter cloud bill.
- 🚀 **Boots in milliseconds.** A single static native binary with no runtime to
  warm up — friendly to autoscaling and cold starts.
- 🧩 **Familiar and declarative.** `#[module]`, `#[controller]`, `#[injectable]`,
  `#[resolver]`, `#[processor]` — if you know NestJS, you already know the shape.
- 🛡️ **Verified before it serves.** The DI graph is wired by macros and checked at
  boot — no `forwardRef` dance, no `reflect-metadata`, no runtime surprises.
- 📦 **Batteries included.** HTTP, GraphQL, OpenAPI, MCP, Redis-backed queues,
  scheduling, CASL-style authorization, health probes and OpenTelemetry — each an
  opt-in crate, so you compile only what you import.

## Vision

A few trends made this project feel worth trying.

Memory has become a serious cost. Provisioning RAM in the cloud has grown much
more expensive in recent years, and for many services it is now the largest part
of the bill. Managed runtimes — Node, and frameworks like NestJS built on it —
are genuinely productive, but they reach that productivity through a runtime and
a garbage collector with a sizeable, always-resident footprint, which also means
more energy spent per request.

At the same time, LLM-assisted coding has lowered the barrier to writing native,
lower-level code. Much of the friction that made higher-level runtimes
attractive — boilerplate, slower scaffolding, a steeper learning curve — is
easier to absorb today, regardless of the language.

That is the trade-off NestRS reopens: keep the declarative, decorator-driven
style that makes NestJS productive, but build it on a native, compiled foundation
that doesn't bill you for it in RAM. One `cargo` step compiles and type-checks
(no separate, slow `tsc` pass), modules wire up regardless of import order, and
the result ships as one lean binary. It's young and moving fast — the ambition is
real, the polish is still arriving.

Applications live under `apps/`, reusable building blocks under `crates/`.

## What the framework provides

Capabilities ship as separate crates, so an app compiles only what it imports
(the headless `worker` pulls in neither HTTP nor GraphQL). The developer-facing
surface is decorator macros — reach for them first (`#[injectable]`, `#[module]`,
`#[controller]`, `#[resolver]`, `#[processor]`, …).

| Crate | What it gives you | NestJS analog |
|-------|-------------------|---------------|
| `nestrs-core` | IoC container, modules (`#[module]`), DI (`#[injectable]`), lifecycle hooks (`#[hooks]`), app bootstrap, boot-time module access-graph check | `@nestjs/core` |
| `nestrs-config` | Typed config from env + TOML (`NESTRS_<DOMAIN>__<KEY>` scheme) | `@nestjs/config` |
| `nestrs-http` | REST controllers (`#[controller]`/`#[routes]`), per-verb routing, route guards (`#[use_guards]`); poem-backed | `@nestjs/platform-express` |
| `nestrs-graphql` | Resolvers (`#[resolver]`/`#[query]`/`#[mutation]`/`#[field]`), self-composing schema, request-scoped dataloaders (`#[dataloader]`) | `@nestjs/graphql` |
| `nestrs-openapi` | OpenAPI 3.1 document + bundled offline Swagger UI, composed from the route table | `@nestjs/swagger` |
| `nestrs-mcp` | Model Context Protocol server over Streamable-HTTP (`#[mcp]`) | — (`rmcp`-backed) |
| `nestrs-orm` | SeaORM database module — async pool via `DatabaseModule::for_root` | `@nestjs/typeorm` |
| `nestrs-queue` | Redis-backed durable job queues + workers (`#[processor]`); `apalis`-backed | `@nestjs/bullmq` |
| `nestrs-schedule` | In-process cron / interval jobs (`#[cron_job]`) | `@nestjs/schedule` |
| `nestrs-authz` | CASL-style authorization: one ability → access gate + query pre-filter + response masking (HTTP binding in `nestrs-authz-http`) | CASL / `@casl/ability` |
| `nestrs-pipes` | Transport-agnostic validation & transformation (`ValidationPipe`, `Parse*`, …) | `@nestjs/common` pipes |
| `nestrs-middleware` | Guards, interceptors, exception filters | `@nestjs/common` |
| `nestrs-resource` | Expose a SeaORM entity to GraphQL **and** OpenAPI from one `#[expose]` | — |
| `nestrs-health` | Kubernetes liveness / readiness / startup probes | `@nestjs/terminus` |
| `nestrs-telemetry` | Structured logs, OpenTelemetry traces & metrics, per-request access log + `X-Trace-Id` | — (OpenTelemetry) |
| `nestrs-server-timing` | `Server-Timing` response headers | — |

Decorator macros live in companion `*-macros` crates (a Rust `proc-macro` crate
can export only macros) with shared codegen in `nestrs-codegen`; these are
internal plumbing, re-exported by the crates above and never depended on directly.

## Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain (1.75 or newer): https://rustup.rs

## One-time setup

Install the dev tooling:

```bash
cargo install --locked just bacon cargo-nextest cargo-llvm-cov
rustup component add llvm-tools-preview
```

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just) | Task runner — equivalent of npm scripts |
| [`bacon`](https://dystroy.org/bacon/) | Watcher — rebuilds and restarts on save |
| [`cargo-nextest`](https://nexte.st) | Parallel test runner, noticeably faster than `cargo test` |
| [`cargo-llvm-cov`](https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-llvm-cov) | Source-based test coverage (uses LLVM, plays well with nextest) |

## Commands

Run `just` with no arguments to list every recipe.

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `just dev <app>` | Run an app in watch mode (rebuild + restart on change), e.g. `just dev api` or `just dev mcp` |
| `just run <app>` | Run an app in release mode, e.g. `just run api` |
| `just build` | Build release binaries for every app in the workspace |
| `just test` | Run the full test suite |
| `just cov` | Test coverage summary (per-file %) |
| `just lint` | Clippy (strict) + format check |
| `just fmt` | Apply rustfmt |
| `just check` | Fast type-check (no codegen) |

`build`, `test`, `cov`, `lint`, `fmt`, and `check` always operate on the whole
workspace; `dev` and `run` take an app name (default `api`).

## Docker

A multi-stage [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile) at the repo root builds **every
workspace binary** into a single image. Which one runs is chosen at `docker
run` time:

```bash
docker build -t nestrs .

# Run the app on port 3001
docker run --rm -p 3001:3001 nestrs /usr/local/bin/app

# Run the default app (api) on port 3002
docker run --rm -p 3002:3002 nestrs

# Run the mcp app on port 3003
docker run --rm -p 3003:3003 nestrs /usr/local/bin/mcp
```

Adding a new app under `apps/` requires no Dockerfile change — the builder
auto-discovers every release binary and ships it.

Security defaults baked in:

- Runtime image is `gcr.io/distroless/cc-debian13:nonroot` — no shell, no
  package manager, runs as UID 65532 by default.
- `cargo-chef` cooks dependencies in a cacheable layer, so dep changes don't
  trigger a full rebuild.
- Rust version and `cargo-chef` version are pinned via build args:
  `--build-arg RUST_VERSION=1.95 --build-arg CARGO_CHEF_VERSION=0.1.77`.
- No `HEALTHCHECK` directive — use the Kubernetes probes exposed at
  `/health/{live,ready,startup}` (the right layer for orchestrator health).

## Applications

### `api` — REST + GraphQL, persisted and authorized (port 3002)

Started with `just dev api`. Persists to **Postgres** through SeaORM
(`nestrs-orm`), so it needs a `DATABASE_URL` (e.g.
`postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost/nestrs`) — boot aborts with a clear
message if it is unset. Listens on `http://0.0.0.0:3002`:

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `GET  /users`, `GET /users/:id`, `POST /users` | REST resource |
| `POST /graphql` | GraphQL endpoint |
| `GET  /graphql` | GraphQL playground |
| `GET  /api-json` | OpenAPI 3.1 document |
| `GET  /api` | Swagger UI |
| `GET  /health/live` | Kubernetes liveness probe |
| `GET  /health/ready` | Kubernetes readiness probe |
| `GET  /health/startup` | Kubernetes startup probe |

Resolvers are declared with `#[resolver]`: `#[query]`/`#[mutation]` add root
fields, and `#[field]` adds a field resolver (NestJS's `@ResolveField`) to an
object type — it takes the resolved object as `parent: &T` and reaches services
through the resolver's `#[inject]` fields. The schema composes itself from every
resolver in the binary (no central list) and is committed as SDL at
[`apps/api/schema.graphql`](apps/api/schema.graphql), so API changes surface in
diffs. A dev run of the server rewrites that file on boot (`GraphqlModule`'s
`emit_sdl` is `true` under `debug_assertions`, `false` in a release build); commit
the result after touching a resolver.

The REST surface documents itself the same way: import `OpenApiModule` and the
OpenAPI document composes from every `#[controller]` in the binary — verbs and
paths from the route table, request/response schemas from each `Json<T>` payload
(DTOs derive `schemars::JsonSchema`, the same trait MCP uses), grouped by
controller. `#[api(summary = "...", tags("..."))]` beside a verb enriches an
operation (NestJS's `@ApiOperation`/`@ApiTags`). Swagger UI is bundled and served
offline at `/api` (the document at `/api-json`), matching NestJS's default paths.

It also exercises the full request + authorization pipeline. Each `/users` route
is bound with `#[use_guards(AuthGuard, AppAbilityGuard)]`: `AuthGuard`
authenticates (`x-api-key` + `x-org-id` headers) and attaches an `AuthUser`, then
`AppAbilityGuard` builds the caller's CASL-style `Ability` from it. That one
ability drives all three of CASL's powers — the `Authorize<Action, Entity>`
extractor gates access (`403`) and masks the response to the fields and rows the
caller may see, `ability.condition_for::<Entity>(…)` pre-filters the SeaORM query
to the caller's org, and `ability.can::<Entity>(…)` makes the per-row check on
by-id reads. Inputs pass through pipes — `Valid<Json<…>>` validation and
`Piped<ParseUuidV7, Path<…>>` parsing.

### `app` — Minimal HTTP endpoint (port 3001)

Started with `just dev app`. Listens on `http://0.0.0.0:3001` with a single
`GET /` returning `Hello World`. Kept deliberately bare — no health, telemetry,
or middleware — to serve as a baseline when benchmarking the framework's
request path.

### `mcp` — Model Context Protocol server (port 3003)

Started with `just dev mcp`. Exposes a Streamable-HTTP MCP server backed by
`rmcp`, with tools declared the same way controllers are — `#[injectable]` for
DI, then `#[tool_router]` / `#[tool]` / `#[tool_handler]` on the controller.

The bundled `current_weather` tool takes GPS coordinates and queries the
[Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com) public forecast API. Latitude/longitude
bounds are declared with `validator` annotations on the params struct and
checked at the start of the tool handler.

The upstream HTTP client shows the async-provider pattern: a `WeatherConfig` is
seeded on `App::builder()` and an async `provide_factory` builds a
timeout-configured `reqwest::Client` from it once at boot, which the tool then
injects (override with `NESTRS_WEATHER__BASE_URL` / `NESTRS_WEATHER__REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS`).

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `POST /mcp` | MCP Streamable-HTTP transport |
| `GET  /health/live` | Kubernetes liveness probe |
| `GET  /health/ready` | Kubernetes readiness probe |
| `GET  /health/startup` | Kubernetes startup probe |

Point any MCP client (Claude Desktop, Cursor, custom integrations) at
`http://localhost:3003/mcp`.

### `worker` — Background jobs & scheduling (headless)

Started with `just dev worker`. No HTTP surface — it runs two transports: a
`Scheduler` (in-process cron / interval jobs) and a `QueueWorker` (Redis-backed
durable jobs via `apalis`). Needs a Redis instance (`REDIS_URL`, default
`redis://127.0.0.1/`).

The bundled `audio` feature shows the full producer → queue → consumer loop:
`AudioProducer`, a `#[cron_job(every = "5s")]`, enqueues a transcode job every
five seconds, and `AudioConsumer`, a
`#[processor(queue = "audio", concurrency = 5, retries = 3)]`, pulls and processes
it (retried on failure). Producer and consumer are decoupled by the queue name —
jobs survive a restart and any number of worker processes share one queue.

Because it enables `nestrs-telemetry` without the `http` feature and imports no
HTTP crate, the worker binary never compiles the poem stack — a genuinely lean
headless build.
