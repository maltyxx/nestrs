//! Schema tooling shared by every nestrs GraphQL app.
//!
//! A GraphQL app commits its schema as SDL so the API surface is reviewable in
//! diffs. Because the schema is composed from the resolvers *linked into a
//! binary* (they self-register at link time), it can only be rendered from
//! inside the app — so each app's binary exposes a `schema` subcommand that
//! calls [`run`]. With multiple apps (and federation, where each app is a
//! subgraph), that logic is identical everywhere; this crate holds it once.
//!
//! The crate is deliberately minimal — emit and drift-check. Federation-aware
//! commands (subgraph SDL, composition) land here when federation itself does.

///   returning a failure code on drift. This is the CI guard.
