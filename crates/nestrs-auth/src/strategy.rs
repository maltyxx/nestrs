//! The [`Strategy`] trait — how a request becomes an authenticated identity.
//!
//! A strategy is an ordinary `#[injectable]` provider (so it can inject a
//! [`JwtService`](crate::JwtService), an HTTP client, a user repository) that
//! implements one method. [`AuthGuard<S>`](crate::AuthGuard) drives it per route,
//! mirroring NestJS's `AuthGuard('name')` selecting a Passport strategy.
//!
//! There is no `#[strategy]` macro: `#[injectable]` plus this trait is the entire
//! surface, so a macro would generate nothing. One is warranted only if a real
//! boilerplate pattern emerges.
