//! Per-request resolution for request-scoped providers.
//!
//! The container is a flat singleton store; a `#[injectable(scope = request)]`
//! provider is the exception — it must be built fresh per request. A
//! [`RequestScope`] is that per-request layer: a transport creates one at the
//! start of each request (the HTTP transport inserts it into the poem request,
//! read back by the `Scoped<T>` extractor), and it lazily builds each
//! request-scoped provider **once**, caching the instance for the rest of the
//! request. A type that is *not* request-scoped falls through to the singleton
//! container, so a `RequestScope` resolves anything the container can plus the
//! request-scoped providers.
//!
//! The model is deliberately one level deep: a request-scoped provider resolves
//! its `#[inject]` dependencies from the singleton root, so it may depend on
//! singletons but not on other request-scoped providers (which would need the
//! scope threaded through construction). Singleton → request-scoped injection is
//! likewise unsupported: a singleton is built once, before any request exists.
//! Reach a request-scoped provider through the request boundary (`Scoped<T>`),
//! never a `#[inject]` field on a singleton.
