//! [`JobContext`] — the worker-execution ambient-data seam, the cron/queue
//! counterpart to HTTP's `DbContext` interceptor and WebSocket's `SocketContext`.
//!
//! A scheduled tick (`#[cron_job]`) and a queue job (`#[processor]`) run on a
//! worker task with no request behind them, so the ORM executor task-local an HTTP
//! request installs is absent — a job that wants to query through `Repo` has no
//! ambient connection. `JobContext` is the orm/authz-agnostic hook a worker
//! transport resolves from the container ([`Container::get_dyn`](crate::Container::get_dyn))
//! and wraps each job execution with; `nestrs-orm`'s `WorkerDbContext` implements it
//! to install a pool executor, so a job's `Repo` calls join a connection without
//! injecting one. With nothing bound (no database module imported) a job runs bare
//! — the current default.
