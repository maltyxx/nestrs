//! Build-time validation of the module import graph (the access contract).
//!
//! The container is a flat `HashMap<TypeId, Arc<…>>`: any provider can resolve
//! any other provider that is registered, regardless of which module declared
//! it. Rust visibility (`pub(crate)` impls behind exported traits) covers
//! encapsulation axis 1 — *what a module can name*. This pass covers axis 2 —
//! *which modules' providers a module is allowed to reach*: it turns
//! `#[module(imports = [...])]` into an **enforced access contract**.
//!
//! The `#[module]` macro submits one [`ModuleDescriptor`] per module to the
//! link-time [`inventory`] registry (the same mechanism `#[hooks]` and GraphQL
//! composition use), recording the module's bare-type imports and its
//! providers' container keys + declared dependencies. At boot,
//! [`App`](crate::App) walks the import graph from the root module(s) and
//! checks that every provider's dependency is reachable — provided by the
//! provider's own module, by a module in its transitive import closure, or by
//! the **global** set (seeds + factory outputs: everything present before the
//! register phase, i.e. the app's shared infrastructure). A dependency that
//! crosses a non-imported module boundary fails the boot with an
//! [`AccessGraphError`] naming the offending provider, the dependency, and the
//! module to import.
//!
//! Only `#[module]`-decorated modules participate; a hand-written `impl Module`
//! emits no descriptor and is exempt. Every provider listed in a module's
//! `providers = [...]` is under contract — `#[injectable]`, `#[interceptor]`,
//! guards, `#[cron_job]`, `#[processor]`, `#[controller]`, `#[mcp]`,
//! `#[resolver]` — via
//! [`Discoverable::injected`](crate::Discoverable::injected), which reports a
//! provider's `#[inject]` keys whether it is built eagerly or later from the
//! assembled container.
//!
//! `injected` also reports a provider's **attribute-referenced layers** — the
//! guards/filters/interceptors a `#[controller]`/`#[routes]` (or a `#[gateway]`/
//! `#[messages]`) binds with `#[use_guards]` / `#[use_filters]` /
//! `#[use_interceptors]`, at both the controller/gateway and per-route/per-message
//! scope. Each is resolved from the container at mount (`Container::get::<P>`)
//! exactly like an `#[inject]` dependency, so it is held to the same contract: a
//! layer registered in a module the consumer does not import fails the boot with
//! the named [`AccessGraphError`] instead of being resolved silently through the
//! flat container (a cross-module encapsulation breach). The macros fold the layer
//! `TypeId`s into the consumer's `injected`, so the graph check below covers them
//! with no special-casing.
//!
//! # Resolvers join the contract through module membership
//!
//! A `#[resolver]` self-composes into the GraphQL schema through the link-time
//! registry, so — unlike a provider, which is reached only when something injects
//! it — *every* resolver linked into the binary is live. It used to belong to no
//! module, leaving its `#[inject]` services outside any import closure to check
//! against. It is now brought under the contract the same way a controller is:
//! **declare it in a module's `providers = [...]`** (the resolver-membership
//! decision). `#[resolver]` emits an `impl Discoverable` (a no-op `register` —
//! the schema still builds it from the assembled container — and an `injected`
//! reporting its `#[inject]` keys, its `#[use_guards]` resolver/operation guards,
//! and the container-resolved `&Service` dependencies of its `#[field]`s), so a
//! listed resolver produces a [`ProviderDescriptor`] like any other and the graph
//! check above governs it. To keep the contract *total* rather than opt-in, the
//! macro also submits a [`ResolverDescriptor`] per resolver, and the boot fails
//! with a [`ResolverMembershipError`] if a linked resolver (hence one already in
//! the schema) is not listed in any reachable module. (A `#[field]`'s
//! `&DataLoader<…>` is request-scoped — read from the GraphQL context, not the
//! container — so it is not an injected key and stays out of the graph, like the
//! dataloaders themselves.)
//!
//! # What the contract does *not* cover (one deliberate boundary)
//!
//! The contract governs **declarative `#[inject]` dependencies of module
//! providers** (resolvers included, per above). One path falls outside it by
//! design — named so callers are not misled into thinking the check is total:
//!
//! 1. **Runtime [`Container::get`](crate::Container::get) /
//!    [`get_dyn`](crate::Container::get_dyn) is an unchecked escape hatch** — the
//!    `ModuleRef.get()` analog. The flat container resolves by `TypeId` with no
//!    caller identity, so a provider that reaches the `Container` directly (a
//!    `#[inject] container: Container`, a transport, a lazily-built handler) can
//!    fetch anything registered, bypassing the import graph. This is inherent to
//!    a flat container and is the intended override path; the contract binds the
//!    *declarative* surface (`#[inject]`), not imperative resolution.
