/// A module configured at its import site — the analog of NestJS's
/// `DynamicModule` returned by `forRoot` / `forFeature` / `forRootAsync`.
///
/// Unlike [`Module`], a dynamic module is a **value** that captures options, so
/// `register` takes `self`. A module exposes a `for_root(options)` (or
/// `for_feature(...)`) associated fn that returns such a value; listing that
/// call expression in `#[module(imports = [...])]` registers it:
///
/// ```ignore
/// #[module(imports = [
///     UsersModule,                                   // static, by type
///     OpenApiModule::for_root(OpenApiOptions {       // dynamic, configured
///         title: "My API".into(),
///         ..Default::default()
///     }),
/// ])]
/// pub struct AppModule;
/// ```
///
/// Dynamic modules are **not** auto-deduplicated: each carries its own config,
/// mirroring NestJS's `forFeature` being called once per feature. A module that
/// must run at most once exposes a [`Module`] impl (the default path) instead.
///
/// A dynamic module participates in **two phases**, both defaulting to a no-op
/// so a kind overrides only what it needs:
///
/// - [`collect`](Self::collect) (collect phase) — register an async
///   [`provide_factory`](ContainerBuilder::provide_factory). This is how a module
///   owns an **asynchronously-built** resource (a database pool, a queue
///   connection) — NestJS's `forRootAsync` — while still being declared in
///   `#[module(imports = [...])]`. `register` is synchronous and cannot `await`,
///   so the factory is collected here and `await`ed by
///   [`AppBuilder::build`](crate::AppBuilder::build) *before* providers are built.
/// - [`register`](Self::register) (register phase) — install synchronous
///   providers, metadata, or config. This is how a module takes **sync** options
///   at its import site (NestJS's `forRoot`).
///
/// A config module overrides `register`; an async-resource module overrides
/// `collect`. The macro calls both uniformly, so the two are indistinguishable
/// at the import site — both are just entries in `imports`.

    /// Register synchronous providers / metadata / config (register phase).
