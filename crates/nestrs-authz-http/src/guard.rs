//! [`AbilityGuard<F>`] — the request-scoped bridge that turns the authenticated

//!
//! It is generic over the app's [`AbilityFactory`], so the only app-specific
//! parts (the policy and the actor type) stay in the app; the wiring — read the
//! actor, run the factory, attach the ability — is the same everywhere and lives
//! here.

/// The actor (`F::Actor`) is read from the request extensions, so an
/// authentication guard must run first and insert it; its absence is a `500`
/// (the authn guard was not applied to this route — a wiring bug).
