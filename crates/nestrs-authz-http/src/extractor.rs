/// it was not applied to this route — a wiring bug, not a client error. This is

/// `#[routes]` also reads this parameter to mask the response transparently, by
/// the type name `Authorize` — so importing it under an alias (`use ... as Foo`)
/// keeps the gate working but silently disables response masking.
